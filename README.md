# Meme-Dancing-CSS-for-Django-Template-


Hey there developers! Like in my hello-world- repositry say's that i am a newbie Web Devolper here. 
Lately i've tried to make a blog using HTML5, CSS3, Python, and Django 1.9. In the middle of my 
work, i was able to make a very simple yet very funny HTML file for one of my templates. 

It's the best design, but please give it a try. Hope this i useful :)
